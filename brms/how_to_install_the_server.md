# Conclusion

In the first tutorial we have learned the core drools concepts that are needed to start implementing business rules. The course example was simply there to demonstrate and help the user to understand the concepts. The exercise then starts to show a more complex case where we have to separate in steps to get the final result. In those two first examples on the drools tutorial, how to interface with a real application was not in the scope of the exercise. In the BRMS tutorial, we took the same approach on how to express the rules and how to test them. But it is never express how we should interface our rule engine implementation with our real application. In the next tutorial, we shall propose an architecture of a drools application.
